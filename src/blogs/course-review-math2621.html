  <h1 class="title">MATH2621 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MATH2621 was the hardest course I took in first year, as it is quite a big jump from first year math courses, 
      I found it extremely challenging until about week 9 when everything started to click. If you did MATH1231, don't 
      expect it to be similar, as it is not like highschool mathematics, and relies more on proofs than MATH1241 does.
      Doing MATH1081 can help a lot with the proofs in this course, also keep in mind that in first year mathematics courses, 
      doing lower or the higher version is not a big difference, however beyond doing the higher version is a lot harder,
      but will scale much better than the lower version, where the lower version sometimes even scales down. Overall, 
      I do recommend this course, as complex analysis is interesting, however I don't think there is much usage, 
      sinec the only application was solving difficult integrals, Fourier Transform and Laplace Transform, where these 
      transforms are taught in other math courses, so I would only do this if you are interested in the content itself.

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      There are 2 two hour lectures each week like usual, however since this course is quite difficult, unlike the first year 
      math courses, the lectures should be watched since the lecture notes alone make it hard to understand. The lectures 
      were quite good, yet some lectures made things overly complicated, most notable being the lecture on mobius 
      transformations (linear fractional transformations) and on any proofs with complex integration. The board tutorial 
      is mandatory as it counts to your grade, where you need to attend 7 out of the 9 weekly tutorial classes, where 
      you work in small groups and the tutor may come and assist you. Note that the board tutorial questions are from 
      the tutorial questions, and they are extremely difficult and can cover content from the lecture the week during 
      the tutorial.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobius Lessons</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://unsw.mobius.cloud/login/login.do" target="_blank">Mobius</a> lessons are extremely simple 
      and trivial, with only 3 to 4 questions a week, and you only need to complete 7 of 9 Mobius lessons to get the 
      full marks. Each Mobius lesson is due the week after, so you should be able to get the full marks for the 
      Mobius lessons component (15%).
    </p>

    <h3>Class Test</h3>
    <p>
      The class test is quite challenging, and has been made harder since there was restructure from two class tests, 
      to just one class test weighing more. This class test is in week 8 and is a lot harder than a lab test in MATH1131.
      The class test is more like an exam, however it is not that difficult compared to the final exam, do note that 
      you should get as many marks as you can from this, as the exam is not forgiving. The best way to prepare is to 
      just do the past class tests and the tutorial questions up to week 8 content, and the class test will be quite similar.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>
      The exam weighs 60%, so screwing this up can tank your mark, it is not a huge step up from the class test, 
      maybe a little bit more difficult. The exam allows you to bring an exam sheet, which you can checkout my 
      sheet in the <a href="../resources.html">resources</a> page. The exam is 4 questions with multiple parts, 
      question 3 is usually an guided complex integral question, and question 4 is usually the most abstract 
      which you may be required to give a proof, so memorise any proofs prior.
