  <h1 class="title">COMP1521 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>COMP1521 or Computer Systems Fundamentals is a lower level course compared to COMP1511, and is a core course 
      for computer science students at UNSW. This is usually the lowest level programming people will do, unless they 
      take other courses like operating systems or computer architecture, as coding in an assembly language is rare, 
      as opposed to higher level programming languages such as C or JavaScript. COMP1521 only requires knowledge in C,
      and teaches MIPS, bitwise operators, floating points, files, unicode, processes, threads and virtual memory.

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      The tutorial labs (TLB) are exactly same as COMP1511, consisting of a 1 hour tutorial which is tutor led,
      followed by a 2 hour lab. The tutorials can be quite helpful as the content in COMP1521 is very unfamiliar, I found 
      the tutorials better than COMP1511, and there also tutorial questions which the tutor may go through found on the 
      course <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/24T2/" target="_blank">website</a>, however I 
      do not think the tutorials are necessary unless you are struggling. The lectures, like COMP1511 are live and recorded 
      on <a href="https://echo360.net.au/courses#userIdentifier=7e648182-0706-4508-8f3a-da7c8444342c_1eced04d-17e2-4cc3-affa-0643f089cf31&viewType=grid&field=termStart&order=desc" target="_blank">echo</a>.
      The lectures are also quite good, however I had 
      a new lecturer, Hammond who created new slides, much better appearance wise than the Andrew Taylor's slides. The lectures 
      go through about 4 weeks of MIPS at the start to make sure you really understand MIPS, and I would say this is the 
      easy part of the course. The MIPS was taught great, and afterwards they touch on bitwise operators, floating point 
      and integer representations in binary, however the lecturer went on leave when we reached the files and unicode content,
      which briefly goes over the role of the operating system, which I would say was not taught amazingly, considering
      the second assignment was purely based on files. The lectures then touch on processes, threads and virtual memory,
      which were defintely not taught well, with the lectures and labs, this is mostly due to the time constraint of turning 
      a semester course into a trimester.
    </p>

    <h3>Labs</h3>
    <p>
      The weekly labs are similar to style as COMP1511, and are found on the course <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/24T2/" target="_blank">website</a>.
      They were generally easier until about after flex week where it gets a little bit challenging, however it is possible 
      to get almost full marks just doing the one and two dot exercises (95%), some of the three dot exercises were 
      extremely difficult, and some tested content not covered in the lectures.
    </p>

    <h3>Tests</h3>
    <p>
      The tests are extremely easy compared to the labs, they are basically an easier version of the labs, however they 
      are timed but can be done wherever before the due date, usually a week after the lab was due. The tests 
      are found on the course <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/24T2/" target="_blank">website</a>, and are 
      about three or four questions, it is recommended to not cheat or use AI, at least not before attempting it and 
      giving a good try, since if you cannot complete the tests, you will struggle with the labs, assignments and exam.
      The test page will have a start button, once you click it there will be a visual timer of an hour, you will then 
      have to fetch the test questions and read the instructions just like a lab, it also gives you some resources, like 
      a MIPS guide and C quick reference, so before starting the test, be ready to spend an hour and have VNC ready. 
      Luckily, the tests are weighted only 10% and is quite easy to obtain the full 10% since each test is worth 1.7 marks, 
      and the total mark is computed as the best 6 of the 8 tests, so you can have 2 failed tests with no penalty.
    </p>

    <h3>Assignments</h3>
    <p>
      The assignments, like every COMP course are very time intensive. Assignment 1 had 4 subsets like COMP1511, and 
      the task was translating a given C program into MIPS, which is extremely fiddly, make sure to auto test, however 
      it is also extremely important to focus on style, as most marks will be lost by style if you are able to 
      complete all subsets, and otherwise style marks are easy to get and good practice. Assignment 2 also had 4 subsets,
      and was creating in C a program that allows file transfers, this should be more familiar, as it was essentially 
      a harder version of a COMP1511 assignment, making sure style is excellent, such as including constants for 
      magic numbers, function comments, function lengths below 50, etc. These assignments as stated before are time 
      intensive, and as you progress through the subsets, it will be more time spent for less marks, therefore
      know what subset you will reach beforehand, then work towards that so you can be more effective in time management.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>
      The exam, at least for my term, was incredibly difficult, quickly recaping the content of COMP1521, which is 
      MIPS, bitwise operators, integers, files, unicode, processes, threads and virtual memory. Now MIPS and files should be
      understood enough due to the time spent on the assignments, however a quick refresh of MIPS will help, but the 
      main issue is bitwise operators, integers and unicode as they are tested in the early questions. The exam consisted 
      of 11 questions, where the first 4 were relatively easy and the next 4 were bitwise operators, integers, unicode, MIPS, etc.
      The hardest questions were the last 3 which was a hard MIPS question (translating a C program to MIPS) and process 
      and thread questions. As stated before, processes, threads and virtual memory was not covered well, so if you are 
      planning to get to the last few questions, I would spend time on them mostly. There are also quite a lot of 
      exam resources given, such as the tutorial questions, test solutions, reviewing labs and past exams given 
      <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/24T2/resources/practice_exams.html" target="_blank">here</a>, note that 
      these past exams were easier than the ones in 2024.
