  <h1 class="title">MATH1131 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      MATH1131 or Mathematics A is usually the first mathematics course taken at UNSW and is similar to highschool content,
      however more in depth and detailed, with the addition of mathematical computing using a software called Maple. 
      The MATH1131 course also has a higher version, MATH1141, which covers the same 
      content with a little bit more focus on proofs or extra content, it is recommended for students who got a combined
      mark of at least 100 in HSC Mathematics and Mathematics extension 1. I did not do MATH1131 as it didn't seem 
      beneficial, the only benefit is the incredible scaling for the final exam, you will be fine taking MATH1131 though.
      The content covers about half of HSC Mathematics including advanced, extension 1 and 2, and builds on a new topic,
      linear algebra which can be though as an extension to vectors. Check out the MATH1131

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      MATH1131 tutorials are a 1 hour optional weekly lesson, in which the tutor will go through tutorial questions,
      in my experience it was not very helpful, however it is good to go through the tutorial problems, and if stuck
      the forum is a great way to find help, nevertheless the tutorial can assist you if struggling, note that the tutor
      cannot look at your assignment (or will not be bothered). The lectures are helpful, but I would recommend just 
      reading the lecture slides, and watching the lecture if something is not clear, and an explanation would help. 
      Lectures are recorded and can be seen on <a href="https://echo360.net.au/courses#userIdentifier=7e648182-0706-4508-8f3a-da7c8444342c_1eced04d-17e2-4cc3-affa-0643f089cf31&viewType=grid&field=termStart&order=desc" target="_blank">echo360</a>.
      The tutorials are not recorded and attendance is marked, however attendance is only used for lab test and supplementary 
      exams, and do not count to any marks, this may be different in MATH1141 where they have board tutorials in addition
      to the tutor-led tutorial, where the board tutorial is where you collaborate with other students in a group and work
      on questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobius Lessons</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://unsw.mobius.cloud/login/login.do" target="_blank">Mobius lessons</a> are weekly online quizzes where the best 6 of the 9 count to your final mark of 15%. It is 
      easy to get the marks required as the Mobius lessons each week are just 3 quizzes, one on Calculus, Algebra and 
      Maple, with 10 to 15 questions. The quizzes can also be redone, however you can change your answer during the quiz 
      so there is no point in redoing it, they take about an hour or two each week if you complete it, and is one of the 
      best methods in learning the content in MATH1131, so highly recommend to complete them each week.
    </p>

    <h3>Lab Tests</h3>
    <p>
      Both lab tests weighted 15% each have the questions posted about a week before the week of the lab test, these lab tests are usually
      very easy to get full marks, and your main issue is making silly mistakes. The best way to get full marks in these 
      two tests (one in week 5, the other in week 9, unless you do MATH1141 then they are a week earlier) is to just 
      repeat the practice bank questions a couple times, repetition lets you memorise. The first lab test has more questions,
      but is only testing algebra and calculus, you can look at MathSoc's <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/5CveQys6YtFmnJFcLtZOJi/9463748444fd36916200dc3fcb4cb705/MATH1131_1141_Lab_Test_1_Algebra_2019T3.pdf" target="_blank">Algebra</a>
      and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjWpJqoxruKAxWZ4zgGHb2NFQsQFnoECB4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.ctfassets.net%2Fxv1hr0zszyo1%2F6n8jFBjXjjfc9t3ahfWxMY%2F86e277d136f6619781b39b1c964825ba%2FMATH1131_1141_Lab_Test_1_Calculus_2019T3.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1HVyJwhXRdqB2fKkVjJw51&opi=89978449" target="_blank">Calculus</a>
      lab test 1 solutions. The second lab test has less questions but also has questions that require the usage of Maple,
      again you can look at MathSoc's <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/2xonmJKvHNGegZgJPlrpwR/e359e69293f66d06587d5b3a2bb18412/MATH1131_1141_Lab_Test_2_Algebra_2019T3.pdf" target="_blank">Algebra</a>
      and <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/4LmyT2dVGPNjSKFo3P68j3/4075c6dc5b6413eb75c17e8c73ab2ead/MATH1131_1141_Lab_Test_2_Calculus_2019T3.pdf" target="_blank">Calculus</a>

    </p>

    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      There is just one assignment in MATH1131, weighted 10%, which consists of answering a couple questions on 
      <a href="https://unsw.mobius.cloud/login/login.do" target="_blank">Mobius</a> on a document which is mathematically
      typesetted correctly either using LaTeX or microsoft word. I recommend learning LaTeX if MATH1131 and MATH1231 are 
      not one of the last MATH courses you are taking, I did not use microsoft word, however I found it easier to control
      the appearance of the document using LaTeX. Note that the markers are extremely picky, and a minor error such as 
      a typo will warrant a mark deduction, so review it carefully. For more information, check out 
      the <a href="/resources.html">resources</a> page.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>
      The exam is where the difficulty of the course ramps up considerably, as the pre-exam marks worth 50% is where 
      you should gain most of your marks, ideally all the 50% marks should be gained. The exam during the normal 
      exam period which has a 1 week break prior is conducted on <a href="https://unsw.mobius.cloud/login/login.do" target="_blank">Mobius</a>
      and has about 12 to 15 questions where roughly 2 thirds are seen questions and a third are unseen. The best way to
      study for the exam is to first decide how much time you are willingly to spend, if you don't have much time, you should 
      at least briefly go over most of the exam bank questions, which most of them you will not be able to answer. However,
      even better you can do the tutorial questions, which helped me understand the content before trying out the 
      exam questions. There is no point in memorising the exam bank as there are too many questions, unless you are memorising 
      specific hard questions. Some questions were given during COVID, so they were purposely hard to ensure cheating was 
      more difficult, so you find yourself unable to answer most questions. The only tip is that exposure to questions 
      helps a lot, and actually understanding the content is important as it will let you answer the unseen questions, 
      or at least attempt them.
