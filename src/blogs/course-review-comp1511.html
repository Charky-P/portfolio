  <h1 class="title">COMP1511 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>COMP1511 is UNSW's Programming Fundamentals course which is taught in C, and it is generally considered one of 
      the best courses and also one of the first courses taken at UNSW for a computer science degree. Generally people 
      pair this course with MATH1131 and optionally MATH1081 if you want to do 3 courses in your first term, check out my
      <a href="#">MATH1081 review</a>, but in summary MATH1081 is quite hard, so you may be better off doing just 
      2 courses in your first term. Check out the COMP1511 <a href="https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/comp1511?year=2024" target="_blank">handbook</a> and

    <h3>Tutorials and Labs</h3>
    <p>Every week there is a TLB (Tutorial and Lab) which consists of a 1 hour tutorial followed by a 2 hour lab, in 
      total 3 hours. Attendance is not mandatory, and you could miss every one, however the COMP1511 staff are mostly
      great, so attending is highly recommended, at least for the tutorial. The tutorial is where your tutor will
      briefly go over the lecture content covered in the previous week, which is what the problem sets are based on. The
      lab is where you just work on the problem sets and can ask your tutor questions and there will be an additional tutor
      called the lab assistant to assist you, if you do miss a class, you can
      complete the problem sets and see the tutorial content on the 
      <a href="https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/CSE_lab_map/" target="_blank">COMP1511 website</a>. 
      The problem sets are given at the
      start of every week, and consist of one, two and three star problems, where one is the easiest and three is the hardest.
      You should be able to complete the one star and most of the two star problems, however giving a good attempt to the
      three star problems will set you in the HD category and good practice, since when you first start coding, the best 
      way to get better is practice. To get the full marks for the problem sets (15%), you only need to complete the one
      and two star problems, and the last lab is a free one since you only have to go to class and do the practice exam,
      so getting full marks should be a relatively simple task. Moreover, there are revision exercises which you can
      complete during the term, or do it near the exam period (you should do it during the term, since the exam period 
      gets quite stressful).
    </p>

    <h3>Lectures</h3>
    <p>Lectures are in person and are recorded live on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UNSW_comp1511" target="_blank">youtube</a> 
      channel, which can be watched later as a lecture recording. The lecturer for 24T1 was Sasha Vassar and briefly 
      Tammy Zhang, who were both great. The lectures for COMP1511 were greatly structured, however I wouldn't say they are
      completely necessary, watch them if you have time, otherwise most people stop watching them after flex week, just 
      make sure to read the lecture slides and code, and focus on the problem sets and assignments.
    </p>

    <h3>Assessments</h3>
    <p>There are two assignments, weighted 20% and 25% respectively. For 24T1, the first assignment was harder and 
      more complicated, taking a couple days to complete, however this may be unique to the term I took it in, since 
      tutors are the ones making the assignments. The assignments are divided into 4 subsets, where the 4th subset is 
      the hardest, most people stop at subset 3, where the 4th subset is the HD level. It is recommended to start early,
      as these assignments aren't extremely hard code wise if you have done the problem sets, but they take a long time.
      The best tip I can give is to not lose marks carelessly on style, which is worth 20% of each assignment, you can
      use the built in COMP1511 style checker, or better check manually carefully. Assignment 1 tested just general coding,
      using loops, if statements, functions, return statements, and mostly using arrays and 2D arrays. Another tip is to
      use the <a href="https://edstem.org/au/dashboard" target="_blank">Edstem forums</a>, 
      a lot of problems you are having are most likely shared by other students, don't hesitate 
      to ask on the forums, there are tutors paid to answer questions on forums. When I took the course someone posted
      an auto tester made with python which covered most of the edge cases, which I couldn't make at the time, so it was
      extremely helpful. I am not allowed to share my assignments, even after the course is over but I may still be 
      able to help.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>The exam is the main divider between pass, credit, distinction and HD students, this is since it is worth 40%,
      and has questions that range in difficulty from a typical week 2 problem set, to an advanced problem which 
      competitive programmers may complete only. There is also a hurdle of completing at least 1 of the 2 array hurdles,
      and completing at least 1 of the 2 linked list hurdles. Make sure you know where your exam is, check the 
      <a href="https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/CSE_lab_map/" target="_blank">lab map</a> beforehand. When I took the course, 
      I was only doing one other course, MATH1131, so I had more room to prepare, doing the revision exercises, practice exams and using CSEsoc resources.
      The exam I sat had 11 questions and started off easy, however 1 hurdle question stumped many people, the first 
      couple questions were standard problem set questions, however question 8-10 was where the difficulty spiked. 
      Question 8 and 9 were tricky and took around 10-15 minutes each, and question 10 was very fiddly, 
      question 11 I was unable to attempt.
