  <h1 class="title">MATH1081 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The MATH1081 or Discrete Mathematics course is a core course to a computer science degree, and complements 
      COMP2521, as they intersect with Graph Theory, however MATH1081 covers it more in depth. MATH1081 is usually taken 
      first year, however some take it first term with MATH1131, I do not recommend this unless you are confident 
      you can manage in the first term, do note that MATH1081 is a harder course than MATH1131, however is similarly 
      structured and there is more scaling. Check out the MATH1081
      <a href="https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/MATH1081?year=2024" target="_blank">handbook</a> and

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      There are two types of tutorials, one is the tutor-led tutorial which those who done MATH1131 will be familiar with,
      and are just an hour lesson where the tutor will go through tutorial questions, most people do not attend this, and 
      they are also recorded on <a href="https://echo360.net.au/courses#userIdentifier=7e648182-0706-4508-8f3a-da7c8444342c_1eced04d-17e2-4cc3-affa-0643f089cf31&viewType=grid&field=termStart&order=desc" target="_blank">echo</a>,
      unlike MATH1131. The tutor-led tutorials are always in the first half of the week, mondays and tuesdays, whereas 
      the board tutorials is the second type of tutorial ran in the second half of the week, it is a much better
      structured tutorial, where you work with other students in a small group of 4 to 5 on questions using the 
      white boards. Attendance is mandatory, however you only need to attend 5 of 9 to get the full marks of 5%, these tutorials 
      are much better than the tutor-led ones, and will help you learn a lot. The lectures are also quite standard,
      same teaching quality as MATH1131, however the lectures are more useful than MATH1131 due to the content being 
      more abstract.
    </p>

    <h3>Numbas Lessons</h3>
    <p>
      The Numbas lessons are found on <a href="https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/my/courses.php" target="_blank">moodle</a>
      and are similar to the Mobius lessons in MATH1131, however they focus more on practice questions rather than learning 
      the content, I do think the lessons are well made and help you learn the best out of all the methods. Do note that 
      the Numbas lessons are marked, however you get immediate feedback and can even reveal the answer if you redo the question,
      so getting full marks is not a hard task, you will only need to complete 6 of the 9 lessons for the full 10%, giving you 
      15% for the weekly lessons mark if you obtain the 5% from the board tutorial attendance. Also note that the assignment
      and lab tests 
      are on Numbas rather than Mobius like MATH1131, but the exam and the exam practice questions are on Mobius.
    </p>

    <h3>Lab Tests</h3>
    <p>
      There are two lab tests, both weighted 10%, and are quite similar to MATH1131, however they are on Numbas,
      and instead of a practice question bank, there are only 8 questions for the first lab test and 
      7 questions for the second lab test, however each question has multiple variants. The first lab test is tricky
      and requires memorising patterns, you can find MathSoc's written solutions <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/wY7ANOLPAqmJPw7RoVnlv/4058fa38527b4f3e509de98300192ef6/MATH1081__Lab_Test_1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
      The second lab test had a change for when I took the course in 24T3 since there were complaints about it being 
      too hard to make silly mistakes, so you could check if you got it right during the test, making the test go from 
      a normal test to the practice version test which made it really easy, you again can find MathSoc's written 
      solutions <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/7c48LpW1VWbBajETvEhs6V/660c3890e2e8f6d3b15ee17145b84698/MATH1081_Lab_Test_2_2019T3.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>,
      however note that it is outdated.
    </p>

    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      The assignment is similar to MATH1131, however is even more focused on proofs and presentation with formatting, this is 
      why I recommend not taking this until you completed MATH1131, so at least you have some practice with using LaTeX or 
      word to typeset a mathematical proof. The assignment is made up of 3 parts, a draft stage worth 0 marks, a peer
      feedback stage worht 10 marks or 10% and finally the final assignment submission worth 20 marks or 20%. 
      The assignment found on <a href="https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/my/courses.php" target="_blank">moodle</a>
      which takes you to a Numbas lesson with 3 assignment questions, note that this is not marked and you can not "reroll" 
      your given questions, so some people may have harder questions than others. The draft stage is where you hand in, 
      well a draft of the assignment, it can be really sloppy and done quickly, and you only need to do 2 of the 3 questions,
      however you can do all 3, but note that you must submit a draft and it must be at least attempted, or else you get 
      marked down, since a peer has to mark it. The peer feedback stage is where you are then given someone else's draft, 
      and you must mark it and give explainations for your mark, this peer feedback is then marked by a staff member
      of MATH1081 and given a mark out of 10 and sent to the original draft owner. Note that the peer feedback you 
      recieve won't be that great unless they achieved a 10/10, but you will see what the staff member marked down 
      on the peer feedback if they did not get 10/10. The submission phase is basically identical to the MATH1131 
      assignment process, and unlike the draft phase, it is actually marked by a staff member who will give you a mark 
      out of 20. For more information regarding the assignment, check out my <a href="../resources.html">resources</a> page.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>
      Before preparing for the exam, check your pre-exam mark found on <a href="https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/my/courses.php" target="_blank">moodle</a>
      and see what mark realistically you need for the exam for what grade you are aiming for, and also check your pre-exam 
      mark is correct. Now quickly restating the topics of MATH1081, set theory, number theory, proofs, combinatorics and graph 
      theory, I would say that there is barely any proof questions besides multiple choice questions or using logic with 
      p implies q, so I would say focus on this the least, and instead focus on graph theory since it comes up a lot. Now 
      unlike MATH1131, there are more explaination and written questions, where MATH1131 had maybe 15% written, then MATH1081 
      has about 25% written questions. There is also an exam bank which I would focus on, but note that the exam is 
      extremely difficult, so to compensate there is more scaling than MATH1131, where MATH1131 had about 3-4 marks 
      scaling, then MATH1081 had about 6-7. Also before attempting the exam bank questions, it is a good idea to at least 
      attempt the tutorial questions and board tutorial questions given each week as the exam questions are 
      structured based off them, this will also help you with both the seen and unseen questions, where about 2 thirds 
      of the exam is seen. Have a look at MathSoc's <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/3nXRBuBBnpSNohJtJSWx8O/3cadef55771ee41cc07a9ead94a4d089/MATH1081_Revision_Sheet_Term_1_2021.pdf" target="_blank">revision</a>
