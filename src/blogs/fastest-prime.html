  <h1 class="title">Largest Prime Number In 1 Second</h1>
  <hr>

  <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
  <p>The goal of this post is to find the largest prime number using code with a runtime of 1 second, we must first 
    set some rules. Firstly we define a prime number as a positive integer greater than \(1\) that can only be divided by
    itself and \(1\), for example \(2, 3, 5, 7\) and \(11\) are all prime numbers. To see the code for this mini 
    project, click <a class="link" href="https://github.com/charky-p/prime" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>Rules:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The 1 second includes the extra time to calculate the time during runtime, but does not count the time after 
        the result has been found.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any computations rely within those found during the runtime of the program, this means we cannot start with 
        a known big prime, however it does not need to store any previous primes, only the largest prime, and it can 
        use the first 10 known primes \((2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)\). To avoid external factors affecting the 
        computation, the program can be run multiple times, and only the largest prime found will be counted. The 
        computations must also only occur on the same machine and no parallelism or threads are allowed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The prime number must be exact to the digit, and not an estimate, and it must also verify that it is a prime
      </li>
    </ol> 
    Now the easiest way to code this is using python, however python is a high level language and is not as efficient 
    as other alternatives like C, so I will use python to find the best algorithm and time complexity, then 
    code the optimal solution in C.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="subtitle">Method 1: Trial Division</h2 class="subtitle">
  The Trial Divison method is to simply iterate from \(2\) and increment by \(1\), checking if every positive number less than 
  \(n\) and not \(1\) does not divide \(n\). The code is relatively simple, with the following pseudocode:
  <br>
  <pre><code>
    func largestPrimeFinder():
      p = 2
      largestPrime = 2
      while 1 second:
        if isPrime(p):
          largestPrime = p
    
    func isPrime(p):
      for x from 2 to p - 1:
        if p % x == 0:
          return False
      return True
  </code></pre>
  This was able to compute a largest prime number of \(15401\) after multiple attempts.

  <h2 class="subtitle">Method 2: Efficient Trial Division</h2 class="subtitle">
  We can utilise a prime number theorem to reduce the amount of computations we need to do.

  <div class="theorem">
    <strong>Theorem:</strong> If \(n \nmid x\) for all integers \(n\) where \(2 \leq n \leq \sqrt{x}\), then \(x\) 
    is a prime number.
  </div>
  With only this change, we were able to compute the largest prime number of \(329533\) after multiple attempts. We can
  further boost efficiency by not checking numbers divisible by \(2\) or \(3\), since all prime numbers are of the form 
  \(6k - 1\) and \(6k + 1\). We can also check the first 10 known primes. Here we obtain the following pseudocode:
  <pre><code>
    func largestPrimeFinder():
      p = 4
      largestPrime = 4
      while 1 second:
        if isPrime(p):
          largestPrime = p
    
    func isPrime(p):
      known_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
      for prime in known_primes:
        if p % prime == 0:
          return False

      for x from 30 to p - 1 incrementing by 6:
        if p % x == 0 or p % (x + 2) == 0:
          return False
      return True
  </code></pre>
  This gave us a largest prime of \(510943\).

  <h2 class="subtitle">Method 3: Mersenne primes</h2 class="subtitle">
  For this method we will change our strategy from computing primes \(1\) by \(1\), and instead look for a pattern and skip 
  numbers. A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form \(2^n - 1\) for some positive integer \(n\), instead of
  checking if the numbers \(1\) to \(n\) is prime, we check \(2^n - 1\), moreover we can make this more efficient 
  by considering the following theorem.
  <div class="theorem">
    <strong>Theorem:</strong> If \(2^n - 1\) is prime, then so is \(n\), or equivalently, if \(n\) is composite, then
    \(2^n - 1\) is composite and not prime.
  </div>
  Therefore we can first check if \(n\) is prime, and then check if \(2^n - 1\) is prime, so we obtain the following pseudocode:
  <pre><code>
    func largestPrimeFinder():
      p = 2
      largestPrime = 2
      while 1 second:
        if isPrime(p) and isPrime(2^p - 1):
          largestPrime = 2^p - 1
    
    func isPrime(p):
      known_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
      for prime in known_primes:
        if p % prime == 0:
          return False

      for x from 30 to p - 1 incrementing by 6:
        if p % x == 0 or p % (x + 2) == 0:
          return False
      return True
  </code></pre>
  This gives us a huge jump in our largest prime number, where without checking if the number is \(n\) is prime,
  we obtain \(140737488355327\), and when checking \(n\) is prime we obtain \(562949953421311\). We can also test 
  \(2^n + 1\) which gave us \(1099511627777\), lower than the result with Mersenne primes.

  <h2 class="subtitle">Method 4: Mersenne primes with Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test</h2 class="subtitle">
  The GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search), which is the biggest prime searching group uses Mersennes primes 
  and the Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test. The Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test is \(O(p^2)\) and relies on the following theorem.
  <div class="theorem">
    <strong>Theorem:</strong> For \(p\) odd, the Mersenne number \(2^p - 1\) is prime if and only if \(2^p - 1\) divides
    \(S(p - 1)\) where \(S(n + 1) = S(n)^2 - 2\) and \(S(1) = 4\). 
  </div>
  This is extremely fast compared to the previous method, as it specialises in Mersenne primes, giving us the following
  pseudocode:
  <pre><code>
    func largestPrimeFinder():
      p = 2
      largestPrime = 2
      while 1 second:
        if isMersennePrime(2^p - 1):
          largestPrime = 2^p - 1
    
    // Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test
    func isMersennePrime(p):
      s_n = 4
      for i from 3 to p:
        s = (s^2 - 2) % (2^p - 1)
      return s == 0
  </code></pre>
  We obtain \(5311379928...728127\) or \(2^{607} - 1\).

  <h2 class="subtitle">Method 5: Sieve Of Eratosthenes</h2 class="subtitle">
  We can only apply smaller tweaks now, we go back to the theorem that states if \(p\) is composite, then \(2^p - 1\)
  is composite, so we want to maximise the efficiency in finding if the smaller numbers \(p\) are prime, since we cannot
  apply the Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test as that only works for Mersenne primes, and the trial division algorithm is 
  ineffective. The fastest way is to compute a prime table using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which has 
  \(O(N \log \log N)\) time complexity. The pseudocode is as follows:
  <pre><code>
    SIEVE_SIZE = 3000

    func largestPrimeFinder():
      p = 2
      largestPrime = 2
      sieve = sieveOfEratosthenes(SIEVE_SIZE)

      while 1 second:
        if sieve[p] and isMersennePrime(2^p - 1):
          largestPrime = 2^p - 1
    
    // Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test
    func isMersennePrime(p):
      s_n = 4
      for i from 3 to p:
        s = (s^2 - 2) % (2^p - 1)
      return s == 0
    
    // Sieve of Eratosthenes
    func sieveOfEratosthenes(n):
      sieve = [True] * (n + 1) // An array of length n + 1 all True
      sieve[0] = False
      sieve[1] = False

      for i from 2 to sqrt(n):
        if sieve[i]:
          for i from p * p to n incrementing by p:
            sieve[i] = False
  </code></pre>
  Note that we chose \(3000\) as the sieve size since previously we obtained \(607\), so we want a number bigger than \(607\)
  which is our limit of what Mersenne primes we can find, but not too big that the computation of the 
  sieve of Eratosthenes takes too long, since it is precomputed before finding the Mersenne primes.
  This allows us to effectively obtain the largest prime as \(104079321...729087\) or \(2^{1279} - 1\).
  This means we have found the first \(14\) Mersenne primes for \(3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607\) and \(1279\). 
  <img class="centered-image"src="../images/prime-eratosthene.png" alt="Sieve of Eratosthene">

  <h2 class="subtitle">Method 6: Using the C Programming Language</h2 class="subtitle">
  We have found the most optimal solution, at least that I could find for finding big primes in a second, however 
  since I coded everything in python, I then coded it in C, using <code>gmp.h</code> to manage big numbers.
  There are two steps to the optiomal method, computing the sieve and then computing the primes in the sieve using 
  Lucas-Lehmer's Primality Test, however we need to balance the time between computing the sieve and using the primality 
  test. For example if we set it at \(5000\), we get \(1279\) as the largest (\(2^{1279} - 1\)), otherwise if we set it to \(4000\),
  we get \(2281\) \((2^{2281} - 1)\). Here is the C code for checking the Mersenne prime using <code>gmp.h</code>.
  <pre><code>
    bool checkMersennePrime(int p) {
      mpz_t m_p;
      mpz_init(m_p);
      mpz_ui_pow_ui(m_p, 2, p); // m_p = 2^p
      mpz_sub_ui(m_p, m_p, 1);  // m_p = 2^p - 1

      mpz_t s_n;
      mpz_init(s_n);
      mpz_set_ui(s_n, 4);
      for (int i = 0; i < p - 2; i++) {
        mpz_mul(s_n, s_n, s_n);
        mpz_sub_ui(s_n, s_n, 2);
        mpz_mod(s_n, s_n, m_p);
      }

      bool result = mpz_cmp_ui(s_n, 0) == 0;
      mpz_clear(m_p);
      mpz_clear(s_n);
      return result;
    }
  </code></pre>
  Doing a little bit of cheating, we find that the next Mersenne prime is \(3217\), and so
  we would require the sieve to be at least \(3217\), which unfortunately gives us \(1279\) as the largest. Therefore the final 
  answer is \(446087557...132836351\) or \(2^{2281} - 1\).

  <h2 class="subtitle">Afterword</h2 class="subtitle">
  Testing with \(10\) seconds, we get \(4423\) as the largest mersenne prime, and for \(3\) minutes we get \(11213\). Moreover, the 
  actual largest known prime is a Mersenne prime and is the \(52\)nd Mersenne prime to be discovered, with \(41,024,320\)
  decimal digits, discovered by GIMPS on October 12th 2024. The prime counting function is a function \(\pi(x)\) which 
  computes how many prime numbers between \(1\) and \(x\) there are, however it has been found to have a growth function 
  of \(\displaystyle{\frac{x}{\log{x}}}\). We can use this to estimate there are around \(375\) primes 
  (the accurate result is \(429\)) in the first \(3000\) numbers, and an estimated \(10^{682}\) primes between 
  \(1\) and \(2^{2281} - 1\), in which we counted \(442\) primes by skipping a lot of numbers jumping to the Mersenne numbers.

  Here</a> you can find the list and dates of when the Mersenne numbers were found (a little bit outdated), where the 
  Mersenne number I found, \(2281\) was found in 1952, and with \(3\) minutes, 1963. There are a variety of other 
  prime algorithms, such as Miller-Rabin, AKS, Wilson's theorem however they are usually used for non Mersenne primes.
