  <h1 class="title">COMP1531 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>COMP1531 or Software Engineering Fundamentals is a group based course, where you work on a project with a 
      group of 4 to 5 the entire time, which many hate. The course itself is very easy, and most people are able 
      to work on the project, however the workload is crazy especially if you have group members who ghost, avoid or 
      just do not do any work, and it makes those who do no work get away with a free high mark. The course itself is 
      well structured, especially if you have Hayden Smith, and is a great introduction to software engineering, 
      however none of the positives can nullify the pain of working with absent members. This course will make you 
      pull multiple all nighters trying to do 3 people's work, but will let you get accustomed to JavaScript and using 
      Git, which is an extremely helpful tool that will be used for the rest of your career. Check out the COMP1531

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      The tutorials and lectures are gerat and similar to the structure of COMP1511, there is an infamous lecturer called 
      Hayden Smith, and is highly praised for having great lectures, so if you do not have Hayden Smith, consider 
      watching his lecture recordings on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgpIYMaJFK0&list=PLi2pCZz5m6GEIUieUdbTritYQZ5LOwCd4" target="_blank">youtube</a>.
      The tutorials are quite standard, however attending tutorials is mandatory, but if you do miss 1 and it is not a 
      demo (more below), then it is fine since there are no marks associated, they only care if you are purposely not 
      meeting up with your group members.
    </p>

    <h3>Labs</h3>
    <p>
      There are only a few labs, 7 in total which occur in week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9, but the first lab does not 
      count and each lab has about 1 to 4 assigned tasks. The other 6 labs can be quite time consuming however they are 
      well made and not a pain to deal with (some of tasks in week 8 are a pain though). The course recently went through 
      a restructuring so the labs are now designed with the project in mind, which is why there aren't so many labs. 
      There are 15 marks, 1 mark for each task that is markable, however you only need 10 marks to get the full marks.
      There are 3 types of tasks, normal which are the easiest, core which are intermediate but are crucial to complete 
      as they are similar to the project, and enrichment which are the hardest and most time consuming. There are 
      3 enrichments, so you do not have to complete them to get the full marks. Note that all tasks use Git to submit, 
      as they auto mark it using a CI on GitLab.
    </p>

    <h3>Group Conflicts</h3>
    <p>
      You are going to deal with a lot of conflicts, unless you got lucky. I was with my friends and one international student 
      miracously, however 2 of them did not put in the work unfortunately, and the international student was great until 
      the final iteration since he got sick, so I could only rely on 1 other group member. It is best to resolve conflicts 
      face to face during the TLB, but if this method fails, you have to tell your tutor before the due date of the project,
      as they will not check contributions unless you speak up. COMMUNICATION is key, my group failed on this, even with 
      an instagram group chat, we left things to the last week and only me, and a friend were willing to pull all 
      nighters to clutch up and finish the project, so if you are doing this course alone, I truly feel sorry for you.
      You have a few options, be the annoying person constantly telling people to do work (low success rate), or 
      just be the clutch who finishes everyones work (high success rate, but painful), or just do your work and tell 
      the tutor, however you will tank the mark. The only positive I would say is that you bond with those who actually 
      do the work, and you can make new friends easily, as long as you are not the devil of the group or the weakest link.
      Every iteration of the project, you will also be expected to complete a mandatory teamwork evaluation which is 
      confidential and you can say what you want.
    </p>

    <h3>Project</h3>
    <p>
      I won't mention group member contributions, as I stated the issues above. The project is made up of 4 iterations 
      (similar to the 4 subset structure of almost every COMP course), iteration 0 is the first, and is extremely easy, with only a one week due date
      you just write function stubs, kind of like when you got the COMP1511 assignment and it had functions that you had to 
      fill in, you are also given the auto tests which will be tested, so you should be able to get full marks easily, 
      however note that you must have function comments according to a style guide which is shown in the project GitLab 
      repository, as it is also manually marked. You also need to do a few other things like using the Wiki in GitLab 
      to assign tasks, communicating in the MS teams group chat, creating a project agenda, etc, most of it will be stated 
      in the lecture and in the repository, also get to know your group members. Iteration 1 is the first real work done, 
      as you complete those functions that you made stubs of, this is where you have to use the Wiki to your advantage,
      and assign tasks, you get 2 weeks to complete this, and if your group memebers are absent, you are still able to 
      basically complete all the functions by yourself. Note that you are allowed to edit other peoples code, and assist them
      with it. Iteration 1 also has a demo which is a mandatory event that occurs in the lab, so you must attend this lab, 
      and you basically just explain what you did to your tutor, and answer their questions.
      For iteration 2, this is where the course becomes hard, as there is a massive step up in workload and 
      difficulty, dealing with HTTP servers is easy if you complete the labs for it beforehand, however your group members 
      may not be aware of this, so if you can try and teach them. In this iteration you will also have a demo, similar 
      to the previous demo, note that iteration 2 is extremely difficult to complete in only a week, and since it is between 
      flex week, your group members may go distant, this is what causes the most confusion. I recommend working as much as you can 
      for the worst case scenario, then you at least have proof for the tutor. Moreover, there are auto tests which are run 
      on every group in the leaderboard website, found on the course <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/24T3/project/leaderboard" target="_blank">website</a>.
      For iteration 3, is it more workload than iteration 2, but it is regarding the exact same content, HTTP servers,
      the demo this time is instead a final presentation which you should have booked in week 2 or 3, this presentation 
      is really relaxed, where in week 11 you just do a demo with a tutor who isn't your own tutor, you can also 
      express peer disdain in front of your peers, but most people don't do that. The best part of this course is that 
      after completing it, you can start making projects, like this website, since you learnt JavaScript which is 
      extremely versatile and useful, and Git helps with sharing the projects and version control. An afterword 
      regarding this project and course in general, is that it is either an extremely low workload course or super high,
      there is basically no in between unless every member agrees to do their own equal part, which is unlikely.
