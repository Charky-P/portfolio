  <h1 class="title">MATH1231 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MATH1231 or Mathematics 1B follows after MATH1131, and is essentially a part 2 to MATH1131. It is similar 
      in terms of structure and layout as MATH1131, covering two components, algebra and calculus along with the 
      usage of Maple mathematical software and in addition an introduction to statistics is included. There is also a 
      higher version, like MATH1131, which is MATH1241 which can be taken if you achieved a credit in MATH1131 or MATH1141, 
      however it is recommended to have at least a mark of 70 in MATH1131 before considering MATH1241, as it is a 
      more proof focused version, but otherwise it is relatively similar to MATH1231.

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      The tutorial and lectures are exactly the same as in MATH1131, consisting of a tutor led 1 hour tutorial where 
      the tutor will go through tutorial questions, and 2 2-hour lectures a week going through lecture slides 
      which are comprehensive enough to cover all the content examinable. Luckily, I had a great tutor, however 
      attendance is optional unless you require a supplementary lab test or exam, I don't think the tutorials are 
      that helpful unless you are stuck on any tutorial questions, and there are no videos to help and you have 
      asked on the forums on <a href="https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/my/courses.php" target="_blank">moodle</a>. The 
      higher version does have board tutorials which may be beneficial, however I took the lower version. The lectures 
      are pretty straight forward, where you have 2 lecturers, one for algebra and another for calculus, I did notice 
      that vector spaces, the first topic of the algebra component is dragged on for around 4 or 5 weeks, and the 
      lectures tend to get quite boring. Therefore, I'd recommend watching on more than 2x speed, or just using the 
      lecture slides as the lectures aren't that helpful.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobius Lessons</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://unsw.mobius.cloud/login/login.do" target="_blank">Mobius</a> lessons like in MATH1131 are 
      easy enough to complete and get the full 10% marks, which you only need full marks in 6 of the 9 weekly lessons.
      There is a calculus, algebra and maple quiz each week consisting of about 10 to 15 questions, and the maple quiz is 
      usually very short, being only a couple questions. The Mobius lessons are generally a good form of learning,
      opposed to watching lectures, doing tutorial problems or other methods, and if you are stuck ask a friend or 
      watch a video to understand the concept better. Note that there is some Maple programming which is taught at the end,
      this is basically only used for lab test 2, however it is nice to know for the exam and you do not need to know how to 
      program to learn it.
    </p>

    <h3>Lab Tests</h3>
    <p>
      The lab tests are structured exactly the same as in MATH1131, and are probably a little bit easier, again,
      lab test 1 is algebra and calculus focused, while lab test 2 is the same but may require some Maple usage for some 
      questions. The lab tests are easy to get full marks if you complete all the practice questions in the question bank,
      which the test is based off, this can be done by brute force memorising or understanding how to complete every question,
      the only trick is practice and more practice, aim to do the practice test at least 5 times. If you are stuck, 
      MathSoc has solutions to all the lab test problems. The lab test 1 MathSoc solutions can be found 
      <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/4HApyKzcvVU4EDopyDH0ra/bcba0dd75a578d061bb283a40e257acb/MATH1231_1241___Lab_Test_1_2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      The Assignment, as expected is similar to MATH1231, but hopefully you can fix the mistakes made in the assignment in 
      MATH1131. The assignment is found on Mobius, and they again give you a few options (less options than MATH1131) 
      for example economics, pure mathematics, eletrical engineering, etc. From what I heard, economics is the easiest 
      if you are looking for an easy pass, and pure mathematics is the easiest for students who are better at mathematics.
      The assignment questions found on Mobius give you a guide on what to do, and have optional answer boxes to check 
      if your result found was correct, however the markers care more about the proof and how you obtained that result,
      either by using LaTeX or word to format your mathematical proof.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>
      The exam preparation is simply going through all the questions in the mobius bank which takes forever, luckily 
      I found the MATH1231 questions much easier than MATH1131, but still challenging at times, however less challenging 
      questions. You can also revise before attempting the exam questions by making sure you completed all the Mobius 
      questions, most of the tutorial questions (this is the most helpful) and asking your tutor for any struggles or 
      confusions. You can also use MathSoc's revision worksheet found 
      <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/xv1hr0zszyo1/2Daxv1fH1C56V0YXylZis/50acb9a713d4fba35d5cacfb12920aea/MATH1231-1241_Revision_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
      , but other than that, the exam is pretty straightforward as it is the same exact style as MATH1131.
