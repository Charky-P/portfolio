  <h1 class="title">COMP2521 Course Review</h1>
  <hr>

  <div id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>COMP2521 or Data Structures and Algorithms is a second level course which is usually taken first or second year, 
      after taking COMP1511. It is a core course to computer science students and covers essential content relating to 
      computer scientists, by learning how to create efficient algorithms and code. Taking this course 
      with or after MATH1081 will greatly help, as MATH1081 and COMP2521 overlap in their graph section, 
      however note that MATH1081 is much more in depth with graph theory. Check out the COMP2521

    <h2>Critique</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Tutorials and Lectures</h3>
    <p>
      The tutorials and lectures are structured exactly like COMP1511, however I found the lecturer I had (Sim Mautner)
      was extremely disorganised and boring to watch, I would recommend watching Hayden Smith's lectures, or doing what 
      I did, which was to just use the lecture slides which is all you need, as I stopped watching their lectures after 
      the first one. The tutorials are decent, similar to COMP1511 and aren't mandatory, I had a pretty good tutor, 
      however do note that you will have to interact with your tutors more than in COMP1511 due to the labs being 
      manually marked, more information in the next part.
    </p>

    <h3>Labs</h3>
    <p>
      The labs can be quite time consuming and there are no auto tests like in COMP1511, so making silly mistakes is very 
      easy, and I was unable to get the full lab marks, which took your best 7 labs out of the 8. Do note that the labs 
      and everything in this course uses C, or pseudocode. The labs were 
      quite tedious, however did teach you a lot, but the main downside was them being manually marked, which meant 
      if you had a lenient tutor you could get full marks easily, conversely a bad tutor is a hassle to deal with. If you 
      do happen to have a bad tutor, you are still able to get marked by another tutor in a different lab, however I would 
      advise not doing this unless you have to. Each lab which is given each week allows for an extra two weeks for it to be 
      manually marked, so you do not have to attend every lab, I think this part of the course was to deal with the usage 
      of AI, since you are expected to explain your solution, however it also punishes silly mistakes, as most of the labs 
      consist of a manual and auto mark. The last few labs are quite challenging too, as you have to use graphs, implementing
      DFS and BFS.
    </p>

    <h3>Quizzes</h3>
    <p>
      The quizzes are weekly starting from the second week, and only the best 6 of 8 count, you can find these quizzes 
      on the website on <a href="https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP2521/24T2/" target="_blank">WebCMS3</a>. The 
      quizzes are extremely frustrating, as there a lot of trick questions making it hard to get full marks, luckily 
      you can change your answers whenever, and have room for 2 failed quizzes, do not underestimate the quizzes, 
      but they are only worth 10% so they are less of a big deal than the labs. A trick is to find some of the quizzes 
      on the internet, and they usually reuse the questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Assignments</h3>
    <p>
      I found the assignments quite straightforward and easy, as long as you know how to use the data structures like 
      trees in assignment 1 and graphs in assignment 2. Assignment 1 for me was a Huffman tree encoding, do note that 
      style does apply still such as comments including comments in the ADT's file. Assignment 2 had 4 subsets, 
      with a challenge in subset 1 which was creating a Big Oh of n solution (limited time complexity for your solution).
      Subset 4 was quite challenging and required abstract thinking, however these assignments are only weighed 15%.
    </p>

    <h3>Exam</h3>
    <p>
      The exam was easier than expected, however there are mixed opinions as many people failed. The exam is composed of 
      two sections, a theory section which is the first 4 to 8 questions, followed by the practical section. The theory 
      section I found harder, and usually just required worded explanations on basic questions, the practical question 
      on the other hand was just programming questions. The best way to describe the exam was that the theory was 
      like a quiz, and the programming was like a lab. I would study the programming part more, since it is weighed more,
      however there are hurdles for both sections. There is also a example exam given, which is easier than the actual exam,
      so don't expect the difficulty to match. This course failed a lot of people, and is a big step up, mostly 
      due to the exam hurdles, so if you are not confident, and did not perform that well in COMP1511 (Distinction or 
      higher), then you will struggle in this course, and it is better to take in second year. You should be confident in 
      DFS and BFS, and most of the theory before the exam.
