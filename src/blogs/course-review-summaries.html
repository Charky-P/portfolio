  <h2 class="title-blue">Course Rating Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    I rate each course based off 4 factors, difficulty, usefulness, workload and overall rating. The difficulty rating
    is how hard the course was to understand and based off the assignment difficulties, note that this rating 
    considers the time it is usually taken, for example a first year course might be rated similar to a third year course,
    even though it is easier. Usefulness is determined by how much is the content used outside the course, after 
    completion, this can be through real application in a job, or it being a major requirement or follow through to 
    other courses, this rating is basically how much I recommend this course if you care about learning. The workload 
    rating is straightfoward, how many hours is required, this can be based off contact hours and time taken for 
    assignments or studying for tests and the exam. The overall rating is just all three factors combined, along with 
    other details such as teaching quality, assignment quality and enjoyability.

      COMP1511 (Programming Fundamentals) is the first computer science course taken, which teaches C and basic 
      data structures like arrays and linked lists. The course is one of the best and gives you a great introduction
      to programming, as C is a low-level language, allowing for more control.

      MATH1131 (Mathematics 1A) is the first mathematics course taken, alternatively MATH1141 can be taken, which is the higher version.
      The course teaches two components, linear algebra and calculus along with Maple, a mathematical computing software.
      The course is basically a recap of highschool content, along with a few new things taught more rigorously and in 
      depth, knowledge of mathematics extension 1 and 2 is extremely helpful, but not required.

      COMP1521 (Computer Systems Fundamentals) is a core course to a computer science degree, is one of 
      three level one core COMP courses, usually taken after COMP1511. The course is relatively challenging,
      as it teaches an assembly language, MIPS and lower level abstractions such as bitwise operators, processes
      and threads. The course is low on workload, however most computer science students dread this course as 
      deviates from easier coding conventions to show what occurs under the hood for a programming language.
