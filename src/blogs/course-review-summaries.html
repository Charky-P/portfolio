  <h2 class="title-blue">Course Rating Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    I rate each course based off 4 factors, difficulty, usefulness, workload and overall rating. The difficulty rating
    is how hard the course was to understand and based off the assignment difficulties, note that this rating 
    considers the time it is usually taken, for example a first year course might be rated similar to a third year course,
    even though it is easier. Usefulness is determined by how much is the content used outside the course, after 
    completion, this can be through real application in a job, or it being a major requirement or follow through to 
    other courses, this rating is basically how much I recommend this course if you care about learning. The workload 
    rating is straightfoward, how many hours is required, this can be based off contact hours and time taken for 
    assignments or studying for tests and the exam. The overall rating is just all three factors combined, along with 
    other details such as teaching quality, assignment quality and enjoyability.

      COMP1511 (Programming Fundamentals) is the first computer science course taken, which teaches C and basic 
      data structures like arrays and linked lists. The course is one of the best and gives you a great introduction
      to programming, as C is a low-level language, allowing for more control.

      MATH1131 (Mathematics 1A) is the first mathematics course taken, alternatively MATH1141 can be taken, which is the higher version.
      The course teaches two components, linear algebra and calculus along with Maple, a mathematical computing software.
      The course is basically a recap of highschool content, along with a few new things taught more rigorously and in 
      depth, knowledge of mathematics extension 1 and 2 is extremely helpful, but not required.

      COMP1521 (Computer Systems Fundamentals) is a core course to a computer science degree, is one of 
      three level one core COMP courses, usually taken after COMP1511. The course is relatively challenging,
      as it teaches an assembly language, MIPS and lower level abstractions such as bitwise operators, processes
      and threads. The course is low on workload, however most computer science students dread this course as 
      deviates from easier coding conventions to show what occurs under the hood for a programming language.

      MATH1231 (Mathematics 1B) is the continuation of MATH1131 (Mathematics 1A) and is quite similar to MATH1131, 
      however most students find MATH1231 to generally be easier since the mistakes made in MATH1131 won't carry over,
      since the two courses are so similar. The course covers algebra, calculus and Maple mathematical computing, and 
      in addition it contains an introduction to statistics. <a href="course-review-math1231.html" class="link">Here</a> is the

      COMP2521 (Data Structures And Algorithms) is essential to a computer scientist, and is an extremely 
      tedious course if taken first year. Taking MATH1081 (Discrete Mathematics) can help a lot, however it goes 
      more in depth than required. COMP2521 is not taught the best, which makes it harder than it should be, 
      but the content learnt is intriguing and useful to other courses. <a href="course-review-comp2521.html" class="link">Here</a> is the

      MATH1081 (Discrete Mathematics) is a core course and is fundamental to computer scientists, 
      it essentially covers the theory of COMP2521 in more depth, however it not necessary before taking COMP2521.
      The course covers set theory, number theory, proofs and logic, combinatorics and graph theory, and is a 
      standard first year mathematics course, with high teaching quality and is much more interesting than 
      MATH1131, yet also harder. <a href="course-review-math1081.html" class="link">Here</a> is the

      COMP1531 (Software Engineering Fundamentals) is a dreaded course due to its major group project, working in a team 
      of 4 to 5, this makes the course either extremely low workload or high workload. Although the course suffers from 
      bad group members, it is a great introduction to software engineering and teaches JavaScript and Git, an 
      extremely useful programming language, and a version control tool that will be used for the rest of your career.

      MATH2621 (Higher Complex Analysis) is a big step up from first year mathematics courses, yet it is incredibly 
      rewarding as the content is interesting, however there is a moment during the course where everything clicks,
      and you finally understand it. My biggest complaint is the usefulness, as the only application of the course 
      seems to be solving difficult integrals, Fourier Transform and Laplace Transform.
