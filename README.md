## Overview
This is my static portfolio website, it uses JSON data and Javascript to sort it. It has a very simple design, and has
four pages, home, blog, projects and resources page. In my home page is a brief about me and introduction to the website.
The blog page has blogs such as course reviews or fun writings which should not be taken seriously. The projects page
is any programming related projects, and maybe mathematics related. The resources page has documents I made such as
exam sheets, or assignments.
